## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a **Counter System** in Python that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** such as:

- **Abstraction** (using `ABC` and abstract methods)
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Method Overriding**

It includes two types of counters:
1. **UpCounter** → Increases its value by a given step  
2. **DownCounter** → Decreases its value by a given step  

Users can create multiple counters, run them, view their values, and reset them to their starting point.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧩 Abstract Class | Base class `Counter` defines the structure for all counters |
| 🔺 Inheritance | `UpCounter` and `DownCounter` inherit from `Counter` |
| 🔁 Polymorphism | A list can store both types of counters and handle them together |
| 🔄 Reset Function | Restores the counter to its initial value |
| 📊 Switch Case | User-friendly terminal menu for creating and managing counters |
| 💡 Conceptual Learning | Designed to help students understand OOP in Python practically |

## 📘 Concepts Covered (Important Points)

1. **Abstract Base Class (`ABC`)**
   - Used to define a blueprint for other classes  
   - Forces subclasses to implement certain methods  

2. **Inheritance**
   - Child classes (`UpCounter`, `DownCounter`) reuse code from `Counter`  

3. **Method Overriding**
   - Each subclass overrides the `count()` method  

4. **Encapsulation**
   - Data like `start`, `value`, and `step` are kept inside objects  

5. **Polymorphism**
   - The main program handles different counter types uniformly

##  Under the Hood
This Counter System is powered by:
- Python 
- `abc` module for Abstract Base Classes
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Method Overriding

## Future Enhancements
  
- Include **Auto Counter Timer** (auto increment/decrement after delay)  
- Store counter data in a **file or database** for persistence  
- Add **Pause/Resume** functionality

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

By completing this project, students learn how to:
- Apply **OOP principles** practically in Python  
- Understand how **abstract classes** enforce design  
- Use **inheritance and polymorphism** effectively  
- Build **modular, reusable, and scalable code**
